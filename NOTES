Questions
=========

1) is result generated here = abstract machine specialized to program (--> Futamura)

2) compositionality of defunctionalization?

3) What is a generic "semantic interface" in the case of an obtained in (1) small-step abstract machine.

4) What is a cheap implementation for context-sensitivity (call strings - do we have them already?).

5) Okay, we've got some flows-to information. How to use it for program transformation?

- relation to nano-pass compilers? shared goal: separation of concerns, modularity
